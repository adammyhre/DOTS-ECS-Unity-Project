# DOTS/ECS Unity Project 1.0.0-pre.65

This project is a Unity demo built using the Data Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) and Entity Component System (ECS) features.

It references two sources: the Udemy course ["Intro To Data Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) & ECS In Unity"](https://www.udemy.com/course/intro-to-data-oriented-tech-stack-dots-ecs-in-unity) by Nathan Farrer / GameDev.tv, and the YouTube video ["Unity DOTS 1.0 in 60 MINUTES!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7zAORa3Ux0) by Code Monkey.

The code from the above sources has been brought up to date to reflect all the changes in version 1.0.0-pre.65 of DOTS/ECS, and differs from the original. If you are trying to follow along with those older sources, this code may be helpful to you.

The scripts in the "Malevolent" folder are from my personal base project library.

## Getting Started

To get started with DOTS and ECS, I recommend following the instructions provided in the [Entity Component System Samples repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/) by Unity Technologies. This repository contains up-to-date instructions for setting up a DOTS/ECS project in Unity, and plenty of other useful resources.

This project was created using Unity Tech Stream 2022.2.14 and the Universal Render Pipeline, and uses the 1.0.0-pre.65 version of DOTS/ECS. You may need to adjust your version of Unity accordingly.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- The "Assets" folder contains all the assets used in the project, including scripts, scenes, and other resources.
- The "Packages" folder contains the packages used by the project, including the DOTS and ECS packages.
- The "ProjectSettings" folder contains the project settings files for Unity.
- The "README.md" file contains information about the project.
